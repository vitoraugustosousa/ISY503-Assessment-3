exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke told trailer not funny even talented carrell can't save co-stars don't fare much better people like morgan freeman jonah hill ed helms wasted story predictable lazy only real effects work presence all animals integration scenes worst most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen whatever cost much didn't translate quality thats sure film succeeds despite perhaps obviously meagre budget ibm glad film didn't go most obvious choice lesser film certainly would addition one most lovely songs ever written french canaan also boasts one cutest leading ladies ever grace screen hard not fall headoverheels love girl negative insipid enough cause regret another 2 hours life wasted front screen long whiny pointless recommend waiting future efforts let one go excellent cast story line performances totally believable anne hecht utterly convincing sam shepard portrayal gun ho marine sobering sat riveted tv screen all all give one resounding 9 out think tom hanks good actor enjoyed reading book children little very disappointed movie one character totally annoying voice gives feeling fingernails chalkboard totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene absolutely no warmth charm scenes characters movie totally grates nerves performances not improved improvisation actors twice much worry not only whether delivering line well whether line any good quite honestly often not very good often dialogue don't really follow one line another fit surroundings crackles unpredictable youthful energy honestly found hard follow

horrorsuspense films go definitely worth checking out problem script horrendous nothing believable all only suspense feeling frustration retarded girls manna heaven terrific film predictable unpredictable time scenes often funny occasionally touching characters evaluate lives going cast veteran actors more nostalgia trip ursula burtons portrayal nun touching funny time out making fun nuns church looking movie terrific cast good musicincluding shirley jones rendition way look tonight uplifting ending give one try don't think disappointed frankly cotton club unfaithful kind embarrassing watch lane gere film bad acting bad dialog extremely shallow insincere too predictable even chick flick too politically correct very disappointing only thing really worth watching scenery house beautiful love lane ive never seen movie lousy hour half wish could bring back terms writing very fresh bold acting helps writing along very well maybe idiotsavant sister could played better real joy watch directing cinematography arendt quite good movie boring sometimes found occupied peaking paper instead watching never happened columbo movie sometimes embarrassing look away directing seems too pretentious scenes ohsomature neighbourgirl misplaced generally lines plot weaker average episode scene debated whether not sack trumpeter falsely accused murder pure horror really stupid applause should given prelude however really liked great film great director movie edge seat made somewhat afraid go car end night music film really nice too i'd advise anyone go see brilliant liked movie way too much only problem thought actor playing villain low rent michael ironside rocked world certainly must see anyone no social physical outlets however didn't make up fact overall tremendously boring movie no chemistry ben affleck sandra bullock film couldn't understand would consider even leaving wife-to-be chick supposedly knocked out several moments movie didn't need excruciatingly slow moving poor remake best friends wedding all all great disappointment cannon believe actors agreed film could not stand even watch very long fear losing iq guess nobody network aired dribble watched putting idb ratings only go low awful time get negative numbers cases saw mirrormask last night unsatisfactory experience unfortunately inexperience direction meant scene scene passed little way dramatic tension conflict central themes film handled ineptly stereotypically no depth imagination all pretty pictures world cannon make up piece work flawed core hour half waste time following bunch very pretty high schooners whine cry life can't relate hell barely understand definitely cult classic well worth viewing sharing others movie pure disaster story stupid editing worst seen confuses incredibly fish badly made underwater shots repeated thousand times film truly truly bad film acting terrible writing worse only possible way movie could redeemed would stok fodder paid too much also real treat see anthony quinn playing crazy horse boring no plot whatsoever no plot all horrible worst hour half life gosh walk out theatre few minutes get relief hate movies like yeah movie pretty much sucked no plot storyline go see movie bring pillow girlfriendboyfriend keep occupied out awful don't think ive ever gone movie disliked much good thing tickets only cost five dollars would mad i'd paid 75 see crap nobody identifies characters all cardboard cutouts stereotypes predictably reversestereotypes bad film bad writing good actors ugly cartoon crafted paul haggis people can't handle anything bold strokes storytelling picture painted crayons crash depressing little nothing provokes emotion teaches nothing already know racism prejudice bad things still like movie empowerment women three's not enough movies out like one brain attempt shutdown part primal impulse self-preservation left shattered experience watching film took good two hours fully recover movie joins revenge bogeyman zombie part hellish trinity horror films certainly not mean distinction good way mean terrible way film no redeeming features everything appalling artless camerawork endlessly presents us ugliest setting imaginable ie story beyond stupid script script kids annoying lead man charismafree utterly without merit any level akin torture ill even say torture maybe would reasonable explanation atrocity not pleasant voyage self-discovery highly recommended premise sound stupid thats yes bad nothing all recommend excellent performance ms garbo showed right off bat talents could carry over silent era wanted see silent work netflix don't seem stocking also great see renowned silent screenwriter frances marion haunt missed step going silent sound movie suffered writing needed more suspense too many close ups movie seemed drag heroes didn't really work freedom movie definitely below average rent doull love movie bad bad film way too long definitely one bad ones movie received great quality film age john wayne incredible job young movie industry screen presence shine thought even though senior actors screen think must see older john wayne film really don't see anyone could enjoy movie don't think ive ever seen movie half boring self-indulgent piece junk probably would better director haunt spent most movie showcasing art work really n't noteworthy another thing didn't really like character got punched face gallon blood would spew forth soon jamie fox absolutely ray charles performance simply genius owns film space owned coal miners daughter quaid owned great balls fire fact hard remember part ray charles acted not played man ray charles legendary ray charles life provided excellent biographical material film goes well beyond another movie musician hitchcock great director ironically mostly find films total waste time watch secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected thriller chase movie pandering audience sabotage most films hence whole story lacks certain energy plot simply rumbles like machine desperately depending addition new scenes usual hitchcock logic flaws mishima extremely uninteresting chilly unremarkable movie author livingworking chilly abstruse culture flat re-enactments don't hold attention emotionally adrift stage rest sits awful soldiers singing songs masculinity pledge hairsplitting purity admiration swords etc bore pieces kill momentum movie quicker anyone else schroder made resume full lousy amateurish films first watched movie loved totally fascinated music dancing everything however recently watched whole thing completely struck extremely stupid storyline contained holes inconsistencies frankly whole lot crap horrid dancing mean realistic world would never gotten ballet repertory whole thing quite pathetic character developments also lacked depth wo talk awful not waste time too horrible worst happiest dialogue could go really made unmatchable direction poor actors can't even tell any talent not only pathetic lines speak director gave no action check directors filmography site see film didn't chance would not even good made tv flick good intentions made film great film might one greatest films

character man underneath malta settings dry barren dialogue movie terrible hockey scenes terrible defensemen playing like 5 years old goalie diving shots feet wide net etc havent seen don't waste time call movie drama ridiculous started watching didn't believe any characters particular relationship bakery assistant waitress didn't work all very superficial movie gave feeling watching play rather film characters very stagey storyline lot like stage farce time pyromaniac waylaid assistant bored didn't care happened next switched off glad didn't pay see didn't laugh even smile wasnt anything all one big yawn really good show watch very educational children 8 years old barney definitely super de super pretty funny babies bop very cute kids very cool too storm trooper not even bad enough make

smack think best actors actresses bonus showthese characters real must say taped most episodes find watching over over know gave don't know exactly movie latched endearing movie become special part family memories totally absolutely recommend movie anyone likes good wholesome family movies exactly things four kids get absolutely hilarious watch one best movies out shows strong sibling bond much more interesting more action more suspense less unneeded controversy everything acting cinematography solid definitely worth checking out damian talented versatile many ways writing portraying different characters screen movie cutting edge pleased know modern day genius out letting passion art drive taking us audience new characters weren't all memorable found forgetting felt though going ireland absolutely nothing whatsoever didn't make scared horrified make sympathetic towards characters simply annoying jerky camera movements also annoying plot pretty much every cheap horror few pathetic attempts give characters depth didn't really work rest plot guess supposed clever twist shed light situation stupid see should probably leave shelf elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina hot gets nakedbilly drago appears cool usual cameo sven ole thorsen helps make very enjoyable movie good acting decent budget awesome movie bought off bay really loved story line power bear kinda cut-out anyone question fort steele ask away totally unfunny movie over top pathetic unrealistic throughout whole 9 minutes utter torture probably looked watch 7 times lucy bell much higher crap sink low quite depressing all movie make sick watching all slickers make excuses stupid actions 9 minutes god never get 9 minutes back think most wonderful parts literally full wonder excerpts works sets especially designed work camera amazingstylized beautiful effective could used exemplars any set designer stories powerful explorations nature man art watching film wanted learn more works artist highly recommend movie anyone interested art poetry theater politics japanese history wind lion see wonderful rendering americans imperial age makes story different terrific production values faultless photography composition editing terrific casting underappreciated brian keith playing bully teddy vivid history though wind lion told largely eyes son every member family identify one characters whether sean connery noble brigand candace bergen feisty heroine john huston wily john hay steve kanaly's sniffy radiant ruthless candy lieutenant roosevelt big stick high adventure best think robert ryans best film portrayed someone like father schizophrenic real life father although never murdered anyone affected more second world war made worse humour get get day apt mother brother thiswhen saw robert ryan portraying type man very good imitation type individual impressed almost all songs cover girl old-fashioned not very tuneful most annoying thing cover girl way rita hayworth put up pedestal unfortunately cover girl example hollywood used exploit women financial gain nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks every part articulated quite well good cinematography also makes monica bellugi look very beautiful good commentary todays love undoubtedly film worth seeing people first timers film making think excellent job very popular cinema good house very good reactions plenty laughs feelgood film thats felt came out cinema northern humour positive community represents rather enjoyed liked couldn't take seriously really created unique feeling though vivian shilling excellent job script world better 95 garbage theatres today role played well not too scream not masculine right camera really likes movie would wasted role ready script european movie nice throwback

elsewhere almost everyone involved must return school acting utterly predictable bad script pile garbage all round wish could enter negative values admits sets bad wouldn't look out place thunderbirds episode use slow-motion needlessly repeats throughout movie well backed up bad acting bad kind word no continuity scenes thrown no reason whatsoever vehicles looked like made corn flakes box directorial style bordered stupidity oh yeah storyline pathetic too hate writing bad reviews films especially really like star film bad don't believe one second anyone could proud not filmmaker nor director would hide head sand i'd spent whatever amount money time movie short monumental waste time energy would not recommend anyone ever see film came free player bought still turned thing off halfway embarrassed howell only no setting interesting premise billy drago always good dangerous nutmeg side note i'd love see drago stephen mattie lance hendrickson flick together talk raging cheekbones soundtrack wasnt terrible either actingeven professionals drago debbie rochonwas terrible directing worse perhaps contributory former dialog childlike camera work barely tolerable still sets got big over scale yes simplifying things sake brevity really core problems film too much going without any real fulfilling explanation good jobs quite amusing convoluted plot didn't convince much film watched weird questioning glance let girlfriend talk seeing bad idea hated last 5 minutes movie also not bad well bela logos totally extraneous intoning odd lines acting decidedly wooden though no worse period universal b movie like armand assent cable companys summary sounded interesting watched twice already probably believe screenwriter good job tying up loose ends 8 score mostly plot wont say any more don't like spoilers don't want one believe film worth time wow bad film not frightening least barely comprehensible plot don't hang together all acting absolutely appalling not even good camp value wasnt expecting oscar material iq particularly stupid mollusc not see one coming film use word loosely insult moviegoing public only someone involved knew string together narrative gets out simply three's nothing lower one not watched recently fox movie channel very disappointed know contract player little control over scripts acting bad script victor mclaren even bad brian donlevy almost unrecognizable considering relations off screen taylor stanwyck surprising little chemistry screen two premise film ridiculous president us death row scenes entirely unmoving only thing worse taylors acting stanwyck singing whatever producer going missed entirely deeply impressed character played knew saw film more great things come gifted actor cheap cheerless heist movie poor characterisation lots undermine style stoic demoting think chow yun fat better tomorrow cheesy cliches thrown abandoned factory ready few poorly executed flying judo rolls la john woo even squibs look awful no point proceedings look remotely like america plot derivative predictable ending like mercy killing awful dialogue hopeless operating everyone gets shot top off real waste space time very uneasy bad movie not scared all dialogue composed things make little sense 3 minutes footage wasted show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough make teen goth blush almost always olde english sometimes latin may may not made up words directing sloppy best hackneyed writing certainly made even worse bad directing course acting blah acting whole cast could put scale balanced perfectly operating interacting finally all get ending would-be great handled competent people not jerry farwell loved movie great portrayal family share ups down end knew special love seen many movies starring jacklin smith god one best though came out 2 years ago movie contained all-star cast loved most opened eyes see actors havent seen movie kind long length enjoyed every minute overall rate movie out scale lifetime not air enough anyone knows store sells let know gustave particularly remember senses assaulted strident cords music would blare out very little warning even less meaning sort pap screened afternoon punish unemployed not jobs totally different loads understatement black comedy film few get see remember movie creates universe

conclusion film left theater lilt step joy heart hope human race doris wholesome appearance gives fine performance rest cast also play well cinematography noteworthy including fine views barcelona famed gaudi towers ten minutes film started second thoughts half way film started dislike time film ended not only disliked despised film lacks convincing script script looks only rough draft written shooting began finished script completed things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur no real reason script calls cast good worth checking out probably most irritating show ever seen entire life indescribably most annoying idiotic show ever seen everything bad could not understand kind idiot would produce mess first place not mention several season script bad very bad contains cheesiness unethical joke normally see rated r ncr movie casting also horrible cause all see really really bad actors period final word show real torture million times away reality watching washing machine twirling around wouldn't hurt eyes much show rating grade z note show bad even mother cast pull daughter out show th century foxes road house 948 not only quite silly noir implausible unmitigated bore movie full unconvincing cardboard characters blandly written edward chodorow also produced surprisingly directed jean negulesco one would expect great deal more widmark character turns unintentionally comical losing marbles early proceedings totally implausible unconvincing n't enough mess movie picture also marred constant use studio sets indoor exteriors whatever prompted documentary beyond very serious spoilers movie huge disappointment many problems dont know start cast great steve martin delivers really funny performance middle-aged upper class uptight white guy add betty white jean smart great cast everyone played parts really well movie makes lot serious mistakes first all enough racial stereotypes racial jokes offend everyone movie littered overt racial slurs
