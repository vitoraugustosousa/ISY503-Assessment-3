1030,sum film breeders terrible cheaply made horror movie should avoided like bola virus not recommended he almost unbearable watch screen he has little no charisma terrible comedic timing aside terrible lead film has loads other debits understand supposed cheap popcorn comedy don't mean has completely insult our intelligence writing so incredibly hackneyed borders offensive lewis blacks considerable talent wasted here too he his most incendiary when he unrestrained which pga rating certainly wont allow films sole bright spot jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable fans recent superb due amount weight he lost interim originality freshness first movie now spent remake little else offer budget evidently very limited reflected not only cast also below-par script which borrowed much earlier classic however here no decent acting action or location work balance things up filming less expansive failed convey broad sweep landscapes great part original generally just lacked imagination not recommended possible movie get any worse than no plot here keep going first place even when women finally show up no sign improvement most expected things happen by time film over might far asleep beware not trashy cult movie trash period can't believe three's even sequel which precisely why am giving such bad review being a's child truly enjoyed show can proudly say enjoyed big time even more than classical wb cartoons tiny toons kept a's vibe delivered one most popular funny underrated cartoons ever created memories murky can only say enjoyed every single episode product related show easily none other cartoon made me laugh tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented teenagers characters all funny peculiarity not having true lead character every single character hilarious deserved called lead every element story so over top excessively phony contrived painful sit through her lines seem been written by fifteen year old though trying oh so so hard sound like how fifteen year old would really um know well talk prado has nice energy level obviously very comfortable front camera simply no excuse something poorly done saw movie thought stupid movie what even more stupid who thought idea should volcano los angeles honest unbelievable nonsense very foolish conclusion will not bother movie because volcano los angeles nothing nonsense story line just awful just painful accents absolutely abysmal three's also enough hypocrisy film make me vomit don't waste your time watching rubbish unresearched film believe pitch black done well characters interesting want find out more about them longer movie goes think people will surprised by who does don't make go watch omit watching very funny rating just 3 out characters interesting really care them instant classic great soundtrack catchy song during ending credits don't miss masterful piece filmmaking many themes simmering occasionally boiling over warts all study poets bohemian self-indulgent wartime years span aerial bombardments london outward tranquillity welsh coastal retreat borderline between friendship lust love dedication art experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice egotism versus heroism self-sacrifice more mature subtle script suggests occasionally brings into dramatic focus underlying tensions well served by perfect performances apart odd inappropriate smiling keira knightley prone though perhaps under direction time other characters themselves often mention above all exquisite visual composition each moment inventive elegant use closeup camera angle lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage wonder joy behold continuously beautiful look bertolucci relationships here more convincing narrative more engaging than some masters work basic premise wasted since sidelined by inexplicable focus documentary crew regardless film fails most levels avoid all costs saw film over christmas what great film thought errol flynn brilliant custer has since become favourite actor his acting alongside olivia de havilland brilliant ending fantastic always known errol flynn brilliant actor he dads favourite actor grew up watching his films child wasnt until watched film realised how great he actually ill give film out know jim o'connor very energetic nobody could much him george well dull he really didn't seem want hosting his voice-overs monotonous didn't get involved guests lovely little thriller hitchcock lots nice shenanigans surrounding murdered spy kidnapped child nasty church foreign plot some random taxidermist jimmy stewart ever great hero hitchcock story rips along cool climax embassy function lacks brooding menace hitchcock black white low-budget original nevertheless yet another wonderful film great masters stable say film excellently produced tops ratings typical sci fi film excellently produced by one scifi's best producers scot handover entertaining nonetheless camp sort film thats joy watch three's barely boring moment film plenty humorous parts cast always entertaining usual overall delight movie so mindbendingly awful couldn't even been created film lacks any real scares or tension some medical terminology used throughout bit iffy say least say insulin dependant diabetic myself least said about acting better movie does excellent job revealing complexity task incredible

football scenes end perplexing thought his acting skilled meredith m better than all right very charming film wonderful sentiment heart rare when filmmaker takes time tell worthy moral tale care love don't fall into trap being overly syrupy or over indulgent nine out ten truly lovely film early film future goremeister lucio sulci very good addition diallo subgenres one best italian thrillers early a's handout scene scene very strong unpleasant technically film well made impressive camerawork solid acting effective music rid ortolani particularly good recurring unaccompanied female vocal sounds like coming distant hill still wild stuff though highly recommended fans diallo cinema movie very interesting beginning end liked way dustin hoffman character ready do just about everything stay his son movie also revealing personally think shows people should learn find compromise them self without involving other people into issue boring am so tired cliches just lazy writing here come thick fast ps only scene movie cool when central character finds her room blown up fresh subtle rather sublime effect italian reviewer called small great film thats right all actors give wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin jamie harris who changes nervous starlet beginning through strange events she part cool star learn lot about real inside emotions people movie lot about movie business itself movie movie situations beginning through game played her by acting coach fascinating also music by mark snow possibly best score ive ever heard wont forget movie why film made film has ultracheap look result film just don't look right none them engaging or exciting plot nonsense don't interest slightest way or any uniqueness foreigner not worth one second your time saw child tv back 973 when stranger loved duet between astronaut his doctor beginning movie perfect exchange one considers movie made well into cold war astronauts biggest fear he has crashed ussr movie so awesome loved really scary love scream movies all horror movies one ranks way up want real scare rent one extraordinary film courtroom drama compelling indictment american justice system frightening film highlights fundamental flaws legal process not about discovering guilt or innocence rather about who presents better court film well paced understated one best courtroom documentaries ive seen mostly routine factbased tv drama gets boost fine performance by cole predictable not bad watch clear she range ability pull off part she carries movie well constantine gives everything right intensity seems good understanding underlying psychological motivations wonderful inspiring watch hope gets released again video or did how piece trash ever released beyond me acting story characters supposedly special effects excites all wrong fact stinker smells like directtovideo release avoid all costs star trek v final frontier worst series acting all involved includes those like shatner nimby bad washed out making them seem old look real life special effects tacky like when spock has rescue kirk jet pack when he falls down mountain attempts humor pitiful story so awful don't bear thinking about which basically involves vulcan stealing enterprise find god seriously just didn't care about any film oh not mention uhuru does belly dance distract male guards only place good film garbage worst one series editing editing film phenomenal opinion when song could explain emotions subjects better such when jay adams unfortunate life subject talk song old man by neil young played which evokes many emotions cinematography film shot interesting way course footage grainy only enhanced film film offers many delights surprises when achille philippa beautifully sing duet don giovanni perfectly describes their situation movie appreciate subtle layers excellent film story unfolds th century jutland use period music played period instruments just one more fine touch share general loewenhielm's exquisite joy his partaking called en sarcophagi even though just watching movie do wish just small sample savoy understated film leaves lasting impression warmth generates contrast austere backdrop will leave theater wanting go out dance under stars acting you'd expect cast top notch characters fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes blake all actors deliver their sharply scripted lines just right amount deadpan tongue cheek make dialogue both hilarious realistic angus scrim also turns good performance somewhat brief memorable role gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn conclusion loved long time since so entertained by movie struggle find anything bad say about mark words one those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm people will still discovering falling love 2 3 4 years down line pretty surprising wonderful film made 949 hollywood generally collective heads sand concerning black white issues time film deserves strong kudos taking stand having exceptional acting mostly lesser-known cast superintelligent script don't insult audience or take easy way out when comes white racism plus movies rather modest budget fast running time does amazing job juan hernandez exceptional actor who played supporting roles many films era proud black man who accused murdering white man south trumbull love lucy see your kids chance will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations come last 5 years see both films can year however reminded us huston still top his game evinced by his faithful adaptation james joyces acclaimed novella dead feelings thoughtsgabriel's discomfort during dancehall these intangibles leap life come within viewers grasp huston portrayal very disappointed wondered how could oscar shortlist very slow lot holes plot three's nothing about how he became emperor nothing about where he spend 2 years between his childhood mature age don't waste your time end days one worst big-budget action movies ive ever seen he surely don't know how make coherent action movie screenwriter air force one who only obliged write script just big sum money one worst films ever seen ibm still trying get over how bad movie possibly one most creative works horror ever has everything could want suspense drama comedy confusing sub-plots native americans brain eating you'se looking ball endill brainsucking movies look no further great sound effects impressive special effects can't recommend movie enough call me nut think one best movies ever great character actors telly savalas peter boyle hour 54 minutes sheer tedium melodrama horrible acting mess script sinking feeling good lord what thinking lots holes script like bad two hour tv movie now imagine every single one those decisions made wrong dialogue atrocious acting beyond abysmal everything stinks trouble writing directing make impossible establish those things make movie watchable like character story theme so worse three's incredibly weak subplot thrown follows little band latterday maronites go after reporter whos working story anniversary killings dumb pointless complete waste time short don't bother movie wont spoil ending pretty amazing best scene movie end wont spoil ever indication writer directors ability held two highly volatile temperaments into seamless union creativity then result powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because our cultures disturbing fascination celebrity distorted interpretations fame film not easily forgotten kevin spacey excellent verbal tsunami buddy ackerman totally believable because he great actor scripting subtle comedy unmatched by any movie recent years characters interesting even bit predictable highly recommended all ages although younger set will probably not appreciate some more subtle references will certainly appreciate one galley scene particular great movie also story acting weak around 4 pm bought around pm started watch around pm fast forwarded remaining film see anything left watchable human being brain wasnt either way sucks script horrendously stupid story starts too fast absolutely no suspense or buildup slightest everything captain rowdy says either laughable or just plain stupid what hell kind crap then three's plot holes could drive semi truck into these holes linda carmellina only thing good film sheds poised amazing dee spider just plain sucks he can't act one least scary villains ever seen he can't write did he write damn movie his sleep bored throughout whole damn thing acting sucks music sucks script sucks pacing sucks special fx suck directing sucks basically movie sucks film tries serious sophisticated thrillerhorror flick fails miserably probably one least effective utterly unoriginal films ever seen entire life piece cinematic garbage captured celluloid avoid any all costs any rate film stinks not funny sulci should stayed diallo supernatural zombie movies avoid film all costs don't know what happened season five what mess only consistent thread holding series together amazing performances leni parker anita dasilva two talons quiet ideological conflict now movie really dislike one most boring horror movies a's mainly because starts slow centers boring atmosphere puppets look really cheesy not good way like puppet master a's flicks story lame not interesting never really explains sinister origins puppets arendt death scenes like previous movies fx terrible felt asleep first time watched so can recommend insomniacs fact film wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams best part about nurse betty unpredictability director neil late uses brutal violence seperate dreams reality along touching drama hilarious comedy can never tell what going happen next otherwise don't even waste your time one just fails create any real suspense killer don't expect anything original or even remotely frightening however some pretty good acting least type film ibm so sorry really can't recommend anyone one most boringpointless movies ever seen secondary plot line incomprehensible relation primary plot line mystifying hated one worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 not quite bad don't understand how garbage got shelves movie store not even real movie highly doubt anyone could ever like trash not movie-making acting like watching wooden puppets moving around reading book thats how bad so am here warn youds not rent movie humblest thing never seen saw short film hbo other day absolutely loved didn't realize how wonderful short really until last two scenes excellent short film hopefully director james cox can turn short into feature length film same cast or win us over whole new film agree jessica movie pretty bad characters one-dimensional even good guys especially bad guys story line totally predictable not much dialogue not much music whole film shot elaborately aesthetically like sculpture ive seen soap operas more intelligent than movie bad characters bad story bad acting really awful not easy watch funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype long time didn't see so charismatic actor screen paolo sorrento has written wonderful story about loneliness tony has built one most unforgettable characters seen movies recent years movie not completely perfect britta di girolamo will stay long time after vision movie rate movie 9 do not know emilio estevez directorial debut pacing interplay development characters well some clever camera work surrounding character estevez plays all suggest natural eye interplay between martin emilio contains same wonderful chemistry we saw wall street martin charlie kathy bates wonderful her characters subtle desperation escapism variation her character play fields lord readers who already seen one miyazaki films he still top form made another worthwhile experience never condescend all characters good genuine hearts believable problems two main characters may two most believable children ever saw put screen so easy love even more easy identify movie greatespecially enjoy visual arts scenery two daughters paint photograph beautiful story also both funny poignant times people who like european films art movies will like movie truly art soviet actually has lot art go rent however after finally watching film realized not only closed mind brilliance depicts also found myself watching over over again one movie never ceases interest me simply because keeps me alert try attempt decipher meanings brilliance indeed liked movies like matrix better yet their sequels think doull appreciate thought provoking mind-blowing experience film will give think film being like dream simply beautiful both rickman stowe play their roles hilt tale childrens book writer who maybe has written subversive tract gloriously fun fast paced fairly accurate portrayal night raver presents idyllic yet serious portrayal ups downs characters lives just whatever do avoid groove antithesis all good about human traffic too bad everyone else involved didn't share crowes level dedication quality did wed far better film our hands than sub-par mess movie seemed little slow first picked up speed got right point showed exactly how government scientist argued humanity reasons gadget enjoyed recommended friends particularly pleased acting ability dwight schultz both actors truly understand become their particular character delivering convincing sincere performance their onscreen chemistry critical entire film genuine films dialogue natural real life writer gorman richard undoubtedly did his homework because all references industry characterise appropriate incredible soundtrack truly captures essence film each track commands sentiment actually contributing scenes characters definitely worth seeing sort thought provoking film forces question your own threshold loneliness haymo miyazaki latest eighth film studio ghibili make no he no pony pony cliff by sea wonderfully fun imaginative look childhood time when seems film animation has been dominated by disneypixar's cgi masterpieces both refreshing comforting know miyazaki still relying traditional handdrawn animation tell his charming enchanting stories enough can not said remarkable animation film art style has appearance crayonpencil drawings wonderfully colourful fanciful act such film should glad you'se gonna drift away earth far possible one wants surf small wave space movies 998 deep impact armageddon one fails everywhere havent choked your own vomit by end by all cheap drama worthless dialogue you'se must bored yourself death waste time still makes up all super ending depicts great sea vessel being taken out by mighty frost just consider excellent story solid acting look film added bonuses instead we got bore fest about whiny spoiled brat babysitting then watched again two sundays ago march th 25 began really enjoy time taped entire thing very well acted done tv movie judith light one favorite actresses think she does superb job film keep watching over over sad movie very good not seen movie definitely recommend she lovely usual cutie still quite interesting entertaining follow recommend

1019,structure film easily most tightly constructed history cinema can think no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute other words content level film enough easily fill dozen other films how can anyone their right mind ask anything more movie than quite simply highest most superlative form cinema imaginable yes film does require rather significant amount puzzlesolving pieces fit together create beautiful picture short film certainly pulls no punches graphics far best part game number one best th game series deserves strong love insane game massive levels massive unworkable characters just massive game waste your money game kind money wasted properly actually graphics good time today graphics crap say canada fun game aye game rocks buy play enjoy love pure brilliance flick doomed conception very idea lame take minor character mediocre pga film make complete nonsequel while changing tone grated family movie wasnt least bit interested not only did only confirm film would unfunny generic also managed give away entire movie ibm not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke told trailer just not funny even talented carrell can't save his co-stars don't fare much better people like morgan freeman jonah hill ed helms just wasted story itself just predictable lazy only real effects work presence all animals integration those into scenes some worst most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen whatever cost them so much didn't translate quality thats sure film succeeds despite or perhaps because obviously meagre budget ibm glad film didn't go most obvious choice lesser film certainly would addition having one most lovely songs ever written french canaan also boasts one cutest leading ladies ever grace screen hard not fall headoverheels love girl negative insipid enough cause regret another 2 hours life wasted front screen long whiny pointless recommend waiting their future efforts let one go excellent cast story line performances totally believable anne hecht utterly convincing sam shepard portrayal gun ho marine sobering sat riveted tv screen all all give one resounding 9 out do think tom hanks good actor enjoyed reading book children when little very disappointed movie one character totally annoying voice gives me feeling fingernails chalkboard totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene absolutely no warmth or charm these scenes or characters movie totally grates nerves performances not improved by improvisation because actors now twice much worry about not only whether delivering line well whether line itself any good quite honestly often not very good often dialogue don't really follow one line another or fit surroundings crackles unpredictable youthful energy honestly found hard follow concentrate meanders so badly some generally great things wouldn't say worth 2 hours your time though suspense builders good just cross line g pg especially liked noncliche choices parents other movies could predict dialog verbatim writing movie made better selections want movie thats not gross gives some chills great choice alexander nevsky great film he amazing film artist one most important whoever lived ibm glad pretentious piece s didn't do planned by dodge stratus big shots gonna help movie makers who arendt very restrained movie business quebec first movie ive given years ever movie needed word-of-mouth promote overall film interesting thought-provoking plus well-placed suited relatively short run time give one look gave wind lion well written superbly acted true classic actually turned out pretty decent far list horrorsuspense films go definitely worth checking out problem script horrendous nothing believable about all only suspense feeling frustration just how retarded girls manna heaven terrific film both predictable unpredictable same time scenes often funny occasionally touching characters evaluate their lives where going cast veteran actors more than just nostalgia trip ursula burtons portrayal nun both touching funny same time out making fun nuns or church looking movie terrific cast some good musicincluding shirley jones rendition way look tonight uplifting ending give one try don't think will disappointed frankly after cotton club unfaithful kind embarrassing watch lane gere film because bad acting bad dialog extremely shallow insincere too predictable even chick flick too politically correct very disappointing only thing really worth watching scenery house because beautiful love lane ive never seen her movie lousy hour half wish could bring back terms writing very fresh bold acting helps writing along very well maybe idiotsavant sister could been played better real joy watch directing cinematography arendt quite good movie so boring sometimes found myself occupied peaking paper instead watching never happened during columbo movie before sometimes so embarrassing look away directing seems too pretentious scenes ohsomature neighbourgirl misplaced generally lines plot weaker than average episode then scene where debated whether or not sack trumpeter who falsely accused murder pure horror really stupid some applause should given prelude however really liked great film by great director movie edge your seat made somewhat afraid go your car end night music film really nice too i'd advise anyone go see brilliant liked movie way too much only problem thought actor playing villain low rent michael ironside rocked world certainly must see anyone no social or physical outlets however didn't make up fact overall tremendously boring movie no chemistry between ben affleck sandra bullock film couldn't understand why he would consider even leaving his wife-to-be chick he supposedly knocked out by several moments movie just didn't need excruciatingly slow moving poor remake best friends wedding all all great disappointment cannon believe actors agreed do film could not stand even watch very long fear losing iq guess nobody network aired dribble watched before putting idb ratings only go low awful time get some negative numbers cases such these saw mirrormask last night unsatisfactory experience unfortunately inexperience direction meant scene after scene passed little way dramatic tension or conflict these central themes film handled ineptly stereotypically no depth imagination all pretty pictures world cannon make up piece work flawed core hour half waste time following bunch very pretty high schooners whine cry about life can't relate them hell barely can understand them definitely cult classic well worth viewing sharing others movie pure disaster story stupid editing worst seen confuses incredibly fish badly made some underwater shots repeated thousand times film truly truly bad film acting terrible writing worse only possible way movie could redeemed would stok fodder paid too much also real treat see anthony quinn playing crazy horse so boring no plot whatsoever again no plot all horrible worst hour half life gosh walk out theatre few minutes just get some relief hate movies like yeah movie pretty much sucked no plot or storyline do go see movie bring pillow or girlfriendboyfriend keep occupied through out awful don't think ive ever gone movie disliked much good thing tickets only cost five dollars because would mad i'd paid 75 see crap nobody identifies these characters because all cardboard cutouts stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes bad film bad writing good actors ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis people who can't handle anything bold strokes storytelling picture painted crayons crash depressing little nothing provokes emotion teaches nothing already know racism prejudice bad things still do like movie empowerment women three's not enough movies out like one your brain will attempt shutdown part primal impulse self-preservation left shattered experience watching film took good two hours fully recover movie now joins revenge bogeyman zombie part hellish trinity horror films certainly do not mean distinction good way mean terrible way film has no redeeming features everything appalling artless camerawork endlessly presents us ugliest setting imaginable ie story beyond stupid script script kids annoying lead man charismafree utterly without merit any level akin torture ill even say again torture maybe would reasonable explanation atrocity not pleasant voyage self-discovery highly recommended premise sound stupid thats because yes bad nothing all recommend excellent performance ms garbo who showed right off bat her talents could carry over silent era wanted see some her silent work netflix don't seem stocking them also great see renowned silent screenwriter frances marion haunt missed step going silent sound movie suffered because writing needed more suspense too many close ups other than movie seemed drag heroes didn't really work their freedom movie definitely below average rent doull love movie bad so bad film way too long definitely one bad ones movie received great quality film age john wayne did incredible job being so young movie industry his screen presence shine thought even though other senior actors screen him think must see older john wayne film really don't see how anyone could enjoy movie don't think ive ever seen movie half boring self-indulgent piece junk probably would been better director haunt spent most movie showcasing his own art work which really n't noteworthy another thing didn't really like when character got punched face gallon blood would spew forth soon after jamie fox absolutely ray charles his performance simply genius he owns film just space owned coal miners daughter quaid owned great balls fire fact hard remember part ray charles being acted not played by man himself ray charles legendary ray charles life provided excellent biographical material film which goes well beyond being just another movie about musician hitchcock great director ironically mostly find his films total waste time watch secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected thriller chase movie pandering audience sabotage most his films hence whole story lacks certain energy plot simply rumbles like machine desperately depending addition new scenes usual hitchcock logic flaws mishima extremely uninteresting chilly unremarkable movie about author livingworking chilly abstruse culture flat re-enactments don't hold your attention because emotionally adrift stage rest just sits being awful soldiers singing songs about masculinity pledge themselves hairsplitting about purity admiration swords etc he can bore pieces kill momentum movie quicker than anyone else schroder has made resume full lousy amateurish films when first watched movie loved totally fascinated by music dancing everything however recently watched whole thing again did completely struck by how extremely stupid storyline how contained holes inconsistencies frankly whole lot crap how horrid dancing mean realistic world she would never gotten into ballet repertory whole thing quite pathetic character developments also lacked depth wo talk about awful do not waste your time just too horrible worst happiest dialogue could go what really made unmatchable direction poor actors can't even tell any talent because not only pathetic lines speak director gave them no action check directors filmography site will see why film didn't chance would not even good made tv flick good intentions made film great then film might one greatest films ever made film has great actors master director significant threat least would-be significant theme undertone fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes ought thrilled both senses imagination characters about which one might deeply care regrettably film fails movie lacks visual interest drama expression feeling celebration very patriotism underlines narrative no actress has been worse used june allison movie yet enjoy watching unfortunately bad movie just plain bad bad script bad direction horrible acting make one plain bad dialogue sucked cinematography can called thatsucked soundtrack sucked acting sucked concert sequences just sucked nice funny so funny overall movie cheap trash movie not funny considering ridiculousness came out feeling angry spoilers whatever else can or can't said about surface superbly crafted cinematography simply stunning say least fx nothing not stateoftheart conceptually show offers little bit everything just about everybody parents kids fantasy and/or fx fans wasnt single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here all things considered job very well done thanks good movie like done released one best mexican movies ever one less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified should felt ranks highly great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmont lino ventura attention given every character complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love hope tremendous excellent drama excellent thriller excellent film up best melville everything about film simply incredible truly take journey through eyes soul child black water thriller manages completely transcend limitations indie flick by continually subverting expectations emerge intense experience performances real gripping crocodile extremely well done indeed black water webster believed thats because used real cross swamp location fabulous thoroughly enjoyed when christopher eccleston took control tardis continuation series ibm not sure what he trying do film turn good day feeling into night disturbing memories than guess he succeeded lot beautiful places forced like everything movie again lame heres where movie really pied me off don't even get me started jerky camerawork when saw theater thought going sick summary witticisms weren't witty plot well said i'd let one go acting bad really bad even billy bob couldn't rise above script which worse camerawork again bad rating out amazing finale possibly best trilogy all time kieslowski never ceases amaze me he one favourite directors one most talented directors history cinema his use colours french flag three films nothing short incredible every shot every scene like work art three most visually appealing movies ive ever seen his subtle connections between three films awesome mention huge spoiler loved ending how all characters three films remaining survivors ferry disaster valentine young judge together old man watching her tv solidifying his happiness over suffering which he dealt those many years couldn't think better way end film smile face great way wrap up amazing film trilogy recommend everyone who loves film movies anything work art out both movie trilogy literally vomited while watching film think one people who found another one moths pearls his performance awarded stunning story which told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually leaves room characters develop most wonderful location lies story contrast all all beautiful directed film nicolas roeg sublime cast ibm translating movies living first movie year working experience found offensive intelligence when someone strives greatness poetry delivers muddled often ridiculous story bunch disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then get worst kind movie some other reviewer very accurately defined pretentious crap those who find movie intelligent or even masterful can only say your intelligence your imagination obviously used try make some sense pitiful attempt our human nature try make sense things one more thing can tolerate political correctness very well ibm all artistic freedom suspension disbelief slavic female character just too much such fun funny movie highly entertaining all angles features outlandish array memorable psychotic lovable nuts so our enjoyment we get see them run around play games dangerous even has sweet moments telephone repair man really funny his reactions nuts bitchy boss truly genuine all characters film tremendously well played really did find them funny actually very smart movie brilliant twist ending love ending so so perfect doull shed tear am so thrilled after seeing movie like will never forget now not just cult cult classic which has more depth character than man underneath malta settings dry barren dialogue movie terrible hockey scenes terrible defensemen playing like 5 years old goalie diving shots feet wide net etc those havent seen don't waste your time call movie drama ridiculous started watching didn't believe any characters particular relationship between bakery assistant waitress just didn't work me all very superficial movie gave me feeling watching play rather than film characters very stagey storyline lot like stage farce by time pyromaniac waylaid assistant bored didn't care what happened next so switched off glad didn't pay see didn't laugh or even smile once wasnt anything all just one big yawn really good show watch very educational children 8 years old barney definitely super de super pretty funny babies bop very cute kids very cool too storm trooper not even bad enough make list wonderfully terrible movies just lame guy who said hers better dialogue his potted plants has right everything about movie stupid even love bad movies do not watch movie shameful would give television series plus could writers smack think best actors actresses bonus showthese characters so real must say taped most episodes find myself watching them over over again now know why gave don't know exactly what about movie we latched endearing movie has become special part our family memories totally absolutely recommend movie anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because exactly what things four kids get themselves into absolutely hilarious watch one best movies out shows such strong sibling bond each other much more interesting more action more suspense less unneeded controversy everything acting cinematography solid definitely worth checking out damian so talented versatile so many ways writing portraying different characters screen movie has cutting edge am so pleased know such modern day genius out letting passion art drive him taking us audience him new characters weren't all memorable found myself forgetting who who felt though her going ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever didn't make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards characters simply annoying jerky camera movements also annoying plot same pretty much every other cheap horror few pathetic attempts give characters some depth didn't really work into rest plot guess supposed clever twist then shed some light situation just stupid see should probably just leave shelf elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina hot gets nakedbilly drago appears cool usual cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make very enjoyable movie good acting decent budget such awesome movie bought off bay really loved story line power bear kinda cut-out anyone has question about fort steele just ask away totally unfunny movie so over top pathetic unrealistic throughout whole 9 minutes utter torture probably looked watch about 7 times lucy bell so much higher than crap her sink low quite depressing all movie does make sick watching all these slickers make excuses their stupid actions 9 minutes god can never get 9 minutes back think most wonderful parts literally full wonder excerpts his works sets especially designed work camera amazingstylized beautiful effective could used exemplars any set designer stories powerful explorations nature man art after watching film wanted learn more about works artist highly recommend movie anyone interested art poetry theater politics or japanese history here wind lion we see wonderful rendering americans own imperial age what makes story different terrific production values faultless photography composition editing terrific casting underappreciated brian keith playing bully teddy vivid history though wind lion told largely through eyes son every member family can identify one characters whether sean connery noble brigand candace bergen feisty heroine john huston wily john hay or steve kanaly's sniffy radiant ruthless candy lieutenant roosevelt big stick high adventure best think robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like father he schizophrenic real life father although he never murdered anyone affected more so during second world war which made him worse having humour him just get by get through day so apt mother brother do thiswhen saw robert ryan portraying type man very good imitation type individual impressed almost all songs cover girl old-fashioned not very tuneful most annoying thing about cover girl way which rita hayworth put up pedestal unfortunately cover girl example how hollywood used exploit women financial gain nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks every part articulated quite well good cinematography also makes her monica bellugi look very beautiful good commentary todays love undoubtedly film worth seeing people who first timers film making think did excellent job very popular when cinema good house very good reactions plenty laughs feelgood film thats how felt when came out cinema has northern humour positive about community represents rather enjoyed liked couldn't take them seriously really created unique feeling though vivian shilling did excellent job script world better than 95 garbage theatres today her role played well not too scream not masculine just right camera really likes her movie would wasted her role after ready script european movie nice throwback time student a's experiences living abroad interacting other nationalities although circumstances slightly different am fan his movie sucked really bad even worse than ticker movie bad only like 3 or 4 buildings used couple locations maybe poor humph just blew movie excellentangel beautiful scamp adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand funniest parts whenscamp caught under curtain when angel scamp singing give never feeling before totally recommend movies coming out special edition june cover has scamp garbage can angel underneath lid just cant explain movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes funnell junkyard dogs something specialty funny laughedkids will love buy when comes outfit has new features now we chosen tortured disgusting piece blatant american propaganda show made americans too stupid full hatred cliches admitted elsewhere almost everyone involved must return school acting utterly predictable bad script pile garbage all round wish could enter negative values admits sets so bad wouldn't look out place thunderbirds episode use slow-motion needlessly repeats itself throughout movie well backed up by bad acting bad kind word here no continuity scenes thrown no reason whatsoever vehicles looked like made corn flakes box directorial style bordered stupidity oh yeah storyline pathetic too hate writing bad reviews about films especially those which really like star film so bad don't believe one second anyone could been proud am not filmmaker nor am director would hide head sand i'd spent whatever amount money time movie short monumental waste time energy would not recommend anyone ever see film came free did player bought still turned thing off halfway through because embarrassed howell only because no setting interesting premise billy drago always good dangerous nutmeg side note i'd love see drago stephen mattie lance hendrickson flick together talk about raging cheekbones soundtrack wasnt terrible either actingeven such professionals drago debbie rochonwas terrible directing worse perhaps contributory former dialog childlike camera work barely tolerable still sets got big over scale yes am simplifying things here sake brevity really core problems film has too much going without any real fulfilling explanation both do good jobs quite amusing convoluted plot just didn't convince me much film watched weird questioning glance let girlfriend talk me into seeing bad idea we both hated last 5 minutes movie also not bad well bela logos totally extraneous intoning odd lines acting decidedly wooden though no worse than period universal b movie like armand assent cable companys summary sounded interesting so watched twice already probably will again believe screenwriter did good job tying up loose ends 8 score mostly plot wont say any more don't like spoilers so don't want one believe film worth your time wow what bad film not frightening least barely comprehensible plot don't hang together all acting absolutely appalling not even good camp value wasnt expecting oscar material you'd iq particularly stupid mollusc not see one coming film use word loosely insult moviegoing public only someone involved knew how string together narrative gets out simply because three's nothing lower one did not watched recently fox movie channel very disappointed know he contract player little control over his scripts acting bad script victor mclaren even bad brian donlevy almost unrecognizable considering relations off screen between taylor stanwyck surprising how little chemistry screen between two them premise film so ridiculous president us death row scenes entirely unmoving only thing worse than taylors acting stanwyck singing whatever producer going he missed entirely deeply impressed character he played knew when saw film more great things come gifted actor cheap cheerless heist movie poor characterisation lots undermine style stoic demoting think chow yun fat better tomorrow some cheesy cliches thrown into abandoned factory ready few poorly executed flying judo rolls la john woo even squibs look awful no point proceedings does look remotely like america plot such so derivative predictable ending like mercy killing awful dialogue hopeless operating by everyone who gets shot top off real waste space time very uneasy how bad movie not scared all dialogue composed things make little sense about 3 minutes footage wasted show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough make teen goth blush almost always olde english sometimes latin may or may not made up words directing sloppy best hackneyed writing certainly made even worse by bad directing course acting blah acting by whole cast could put scale balanced perfectly between operating interacting finally after all we get ending would-be been great been handled by competent people not jerry farwell loved movie great portrayal family who share ups down end knew special love each other seen many movies starring jacklin smith god one her best though came out 2 years ago movie contained all-star cast what loved most opened eyes see other actors who havent seen before movie kind long length enjoyed every minute overall rate movie out scale lifetime does not air enough so anyone knows what store sells let me know because gustave particularly remember senses being assaulted by strident cords music would blare out very little warning even less meaning just sort pap screened afternoon punish unemployed not having jobs totally different loads understatement black comedy film few get see those who do will remember movie creates own universe fascinating every way movie really got me see really hope team behind movie makes more movies will continue do so their own some kinda weird style forgot casting here superb trend fauna aurvåg being perfect role bothersome man who don't understand where he what he doing why movie good humorous comment life 26 found move beautiful enjoyable uplifting initially local sites film which filmed here buffalo intrigued me later found myself lost power film entire audience applauded conclusion film left theater lilt step joy heart hope human race doris has wholesome appearance gives fine performance rest cast also play well cinematography noteworthy including fine views barcelona famed gaudi towers about ten minutes into film started having second thoughts about half way through film started dislike by time film ended not only disliked despised what film lacks convincing script script looks only rough draft written shooting began before finished script completed things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur no real reason other than script calls cast good worth checking out probably most irritating show ever seen entire life indescribably most annoying idiotic show ever seen everything about just bad could not understand what kind idiot would produce mess first place not mention several season script bad very bad contains both cheesiness unethical joke normally see rated r or ncr movie casting also horrible cause all see really really bad actors period final word show real torture million times away reality watching washing machine twirling around wouldn't hurt your eyes much show rating grade z note show so bad even mother cast pull her daughter out show th century foxes road house 948 not only quite silly noir implausible unmitigated bore movie full unconvincing cardboard characters blandly written by edward chodorow who also produced surprisingly directed by jean negulesco whom one would expect great deal more here widmark character turns unintentionally comical his losing his marbles so early proceedings totally implausible unconvincing n't enough mess movie picture also marred constant use studio sets indoor exteriors whatever prompted such documentary beyond me very serious spoilers movie huge disappointment so many problems dont know where start cast great steve martin delivers really funny performance middle-aged upper class uptight white guy add betty white jean smart great cast everyone played their parts really well movie makes lot serious mistakes first all enough racial stereotypes racial jokes offend everyone movie littered overt racial slurs towards black cast members return whites depicted morons boobs putting race card aside lets look major flaw film destroy latifa's character no real plot couldnt see movie again free steamboat willie amazingly important film our cinema history second appearance mickey mouse following silent plane crazy earlier year probably his most famous filmmostly because so ground-breaking while don't yet hear mickey speak tons sound effects music throughout filmsomething we take granted now which huge crowd pleaser 928 however after seeing short again after about 25 years amazed how timeless film actually just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey straw highly imaginative occasionally cruel way clever real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickey best films even after 8 wonderful years polarity ruthless thug one minute ruthless killer next minute lives diaper commercial completely unconvincing ibm terribly disappointed film would receive so many awards accolades especially when far more deserving works film out original body soul 947 masterpiece john garfield ann revere lili palmer william conrad canada leland filmed by one greatest cinematographer ever grace screenjames wong howe don't think any redeeming qualities remake may only bad film he ever made so badwellit's just bad movie solid example bad plot very very bad idea all way shame see good actors like thompson james make living mess like thought bad both films terrible credit 986 version watchable let's start all problemsthe acting especially lead professor very very bad script big flawed mess best example how dumb writing when established can turn zombiestudents back into humans by removing necklace containing piece meteorite director paul matthews who also wrotedirected weak 995 monster movie grim clearly don't know how pace his films,0
